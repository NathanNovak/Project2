1,Troegenator Double Bock,Troegenator Brewing,25,"Monks had fasting figured out. No food? No problem. Just drink a Double Bock. Thick and chewy with intense notes of caramel, chocolate and dried stone fruit, ‘Nator (as we call him) serves as a tribute to this liquid bread style."
2,St-Ambrose Oatmeal Stout,Brasseire McAuslan,45,"St-Ambroise Oatmeal Stout’s expert blend of deeply roasted malts has made it an international medal winner, including one of the nine Platinum medals awarded at the 1994 World Beer Cup. You’ll fall in love with your first sip of this rich brew punctuated by espresso and chocolate notes, topped with a thick, creamy head with just a hint of mocha."
3,Tequila  Barrel Lime Gose,Boulevard Brewing Company,15,"A traditional German-style sour beer, infused with sea salt, coriander and lime peel, goes on holiday to the home of the blue agave, sunny Mexico. The aroma offers assertive notes of oak, vanilla, caramelized banana, and coconut. A malty sweetness is balanced by tart lime and hints of lively tequila, tapering to a slightly salty finish. ¡Arriba!"
4,Yakima IPA,Le Castor,80,"This beer pays homage to the powerful aromas of West Coast hops, grown east of the Cascade Mountains. We add several varieties of this hops at different stages of brewing. Their lemony aromas, accented by raw hopping, happily brighten the roundness of the malts used."
5,Pliny the Elder,Russian River Brewing,100,"Pliny the Elder is brewed with Amarillo, Centennial, CTZ, and Simcoe hops. It is well-balanced with malt, hops, and alcohol, slightly bitter with a fresh hop aroma of floral, citrus, and pine. Best enjoyed FRESH! That is why we make it in such limited supply. Actual bottling date is printed on each bottle!"
6,Dragoon IPA,Dragoon Brewing Company,83,"This is a true West Coast IPA - deep gold in color, featuring a dank, herbal, citrusy hop aroma supported by a sparse malt backbone. It is appropriately bitter, with a relatively high alcohol content. Pair Dragoon IPA with spicy dishes (like chile verde or ph?), but if spice isn't your thing, you can't go wrong with any aged sharp cheddar."
7,Barrio Blonde,Barrio Breweing Company,14,"You’ll never forget your first blonde. Light and crisp, with a hint of malt. With just enough Czechoslovakian Saaz hops to balance out the sweetness."
8,Guinness,Guinness Brewing Company,45,"Rich and creamy. Distinctively black. Velvety in its finish. This iconic beer is defined by harmony. Sip after sip, sweet counters bitter as the malt arrives on cue to compliment a base of roasted barley. Just as the unmistakable white head sits flush atop the dark beer, so do the flavors counter and combine perfectly. This is our greatest innovation. Truly unique. Perfectly balanced. "
